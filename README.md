*A project proposal presented to the Faculty of College of Informatics and Computing Sciences, Batangas State University - The National Engineering University, in partial fulfillment of the requirements in the course IT 331: Application Development and Emerging Technologies and IT 332: Integrative Programming and Technologies*




# Project Description

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EcoMate is an innovative solution built to promote environmental friendly waste management strategies and pave the way for a greener future. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, EcoMate strives to promote effective resource optimization, recycling, and garbage disposal through a user-friendly platform. EcoMate fosters cooperative efforts in addressing the global trash challenge by bringing together people, companies, and waste management groups. It also encourages ecologically responsible behavior and supports a circular economy. </p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imaginative mobile software called EcoMate combines revolutionary capabilities like object identification, reading materials, and user account functionality to make it easier to implement a sustainable waste management strategy. EcoMate equips individuals and communities with the tools they need to actively contribute to the development of a greener and more sustainable future by utilizing cutting-edge technology.</</p>

<h2> Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) </h2>
This project seeks to contribute to the attainment of the following SDGs:

![sdg12](https://github.com/eynjiljoy/IT331_IT332_Final_Project/assets/113650068/853f63be-4d46-4795-8e81-2dabd6dc83ea)

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally sustainable consumption and production patterns are the goal of SDG 12. It emphasizes on resource efficiency, reducing waste production, and putting into practice waste management techniques that are friendly to the environment. This objective places a focus on the necessity of reducing waste generation and increasing recycling, reuse, and safe disposal techniques which will be promoted through the features that EcoMate has.</p>

![sdg13](https://github.com/eynjiljoy/IT331_IT332_Final_Project/assets/113650068/8a17cfaa-10d3-42b4-95e2-bf04ee07a611)

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This SDG emphasizes combating climate change, strengthening resilience, and mitigating emissions through urgent action. Although EcoMate may not directly fulfill all of the goals in this SDG, it can help with efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. This application will encourage users to adopt habits that lessen trash production, favor recycling and composting, and discourage the disposal of waste through incineration, which will lead to a reduction in emissions and aid in efforts to mitigateÂ climate change.</p>

# Development Model

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application's developers have utilized agile development model in creating the application. As shown in the figure below, the model is consist of six phases namely Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Launching and Review. The framework allows the developers to modify each processes to fulfill the objectives.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first phase of the development model wherein the developers have identified the objectives of creating the application. Throughout this phase, the developers do comprehensive research and gather relevant insights in order to gain an accurate understanding of the desired outcomes. In addition to defining the objectives, the developers begin the process of identifying a variety of requirements that must be met in order for the application to be successful. These requirements include determining the best programming languages to use. The developers carefully evaluate various programming languages, taking into account criteria such as application functionality, scalability, performance, and compatibility. The developers prepare the path for faster development, efficient code implementation, and optimal resource utilisation by carefully determining the programming languages that will be used. </p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phase entails a careful process of detailing the application's features, structures, criteria, and deliverables in line with the specifications. The developers considers factors such as functionality, user experience, and system architecture. They have extensive discussions and brainstorming sessions to conceptualise and outline the essential components and functionality of the application. During this process, the developers take into account a variety of criteria like as visual aesthetics, layout design, navigation flow, and interactive components. They utilise their knowledge of user interface design concepts like consistency, simplicity, and responsiveness to build an interface that not only fits functional needs yet also improves the entire user experience.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this phase, the developers takes the architectural and design requirements from the earlier phases and begins writing the source code that will execute the application's capabilities. They choose the proper programming languages, frameworks, and tools based upon the needs and technical factors specified previously in the development process.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this phase, intensive testing is performed to guarantee that the application runs properly with few to no defects or issues. Testing is critical in verifying the application's functionality and dependability, ensuring that it satisfies the defined criteria and functions as intended. Throughout the testing phase, developers carefully execute test cases, simulate numerous situations, and observe the performance and behaviour of the application. They find and fix any problems, errors, or inconsistencies that arise during the testing process. They also carry out performance testing to determine the application's response time, scalability, and resource utilisation under various loads and stress circumstances. </p>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phase involves deploying the application for mass usage in a real-world environment. Throughout the deployment phase, the goal is to fulfill customer expectations through a high-quality solution. A flawless user experience is facilitated by efficient deployment and configuration, as well as vigilant monitoring and preventative maintenance. As the application is made more widely accessible and more people can take advantage of its capabilities, this phase lays the groundwork for future growth and success.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phase is critical for resolving any issues or bugs that may have occurred during the application's launch, as well as for constantly enhancing the application based on user input and developing demands. It is an iterative process that includes finding and addressing bugs as well as introducing changes to improve the application's performance, stability, and usability.</p>




# System Architecture

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this phase it typically represented through architectural diagram, which provide visual representation of the system's structure and its interaction with external entities. It requires a deep understanding of the system's purpose to consider the future growth of the system.</p>

<h3>Use Case Diagram</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team presented the use case diagram above to illustrate the users' interaction in the application. The diagrams show that the user may log in, sign up, view pages, view category pages, and view the procedures in the mobile application. This might help the user to know what the right things to do are in order to reduce waste. </p>

<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sequence diagram shows the sequential order of the application's sign-up, log-in, and navigational interactions. Users can sign up or log in by entering their information in the appropriate fields on the sign-up or log-in forms, respectively. They can visit the homepage and browse through the many categories and processes after a successful authentication. In the application, the diagrams provide a clear representation of user activities and system replies. </p>
