*A project proposal presented to the Faculty of College of Informatics and Computing Sciences, Batangas State University - The National Engineering University, in partial fulfillment of the requirements in the course IT 331: Application Development and Emerging Technologies and IT 332: Integrative Programming and Technologies*

# Description

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EcoMate is an innovative solution built to promote environmental friendly waste management strategies and pave the way for a greener future. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, EcoMate strives to promote effective resource optimization, recycling, and garbage disposal through a user-friendly platform. EcoMate fosters cooperative efforts in addressing the global trash challenge by bringing together people, companies, and waste management groups. It also encourages ecologically responsible behavior and supports a circular economy. </p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imaginative mobile software called EcoMate combines revolutionary capabilities like object identification, barcode scanning, advanced search, voice assistance, reading materials, and user account functionality to make it easier to implement a sustainable waste management strategy. EcoMate equips individuals and communities with the tools they need to actively contribute to the development of a greener and more sustainable future by utilizing cutting-edge technology.</p>

# Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
This project seeks to contribute to the attainment of the following SDGs:

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally sustainable consumption and production patterns are the goal of SDG 12. It emphasizes on resource efficiency, reducing waste production, and putting into practice waste management techniques that are friendly to the environment. This objective places a focus on the necessity of reducing waste generation and increasing recycling, reuse, and safe disposal techniques.</p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although EcoMate may not directly fulfill all of the goals in this SDG, it can help with efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. This application will encourage users to adopt habits that lessen trash production, favor recycling and composting, and discourage the disposal of waste through incineration, which will lead to a reduction in emissions and aid in efforts to mitigateÂ climate change.</p>
