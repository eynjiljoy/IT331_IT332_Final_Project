# Introduction

Filipino cuisine stands out as a true culinary tapestry when it comes to colorful and diverse culinary traditions. Filipino cuisine delivers a seductive blend of flavors, textures, and scents that genuinely entice the senses. It is rooted in a rich cultural background and inspired by many culinary traditions.

However, finding real and trustworthy recipes for Filipino food can be difficult, particularly for people who live outside of the Philippines or in places where Filipino cuisine is not widely popular.
compared to other international cuisines, Filipino cuisines may not be as frequently offered in traditional recipe sources. Traditional Filipino cooking is written in the local language, making it challenging for non-speakers to access and comprehend them.

TastyFusion is an application wherein individuals will be provided with recipies of the Filipino cuisines which they can be accessed through their desired languages. Users could easily look for the cuisine that they'll be making as the app provides search bar. They will be provided with a step-by-step process of preparing and cooking their chosen cuisine. Moreover, the app will provide video tutorials for some dishes for an easier process. 

With TastyFusion, get ready to stimulate your senses, tantalize your taste buds, and release your inner chef with the Filipino Dishes.
