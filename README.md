# Project Title: EcoMate: Catalyzing Sustainable Waste Solutions for a Greener Future
*A project proposal presented to the Faculty of College of Informatics and Computing Sciences, Batangas State University - The National Engineering University, in partial fulfillment of the requirements in the course IT 331: Application Development and Emerging Technologies and IT 332: Integrative Programming and Technologies*

# Project Description

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EcoMate is an innovative solution built to promote environmental friendly waste management strategies and pave the way for a greener future. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, EcoMate strives to promote effective resource optimization, recycling, and garbage disposal through a user-friendly platform. EcoMate fosters cooperative efforts in addressing the global trash challenge by bringing together people, companies, and waste management groups. It also encourages ecologically responsible behavior and supports a circular economy. </p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imaginative mobile software called EcoMate combines revolutionary capabilities like object identification, advanced search, reading materials, and user account functionality to make it easier to implement a sustainable waste management strategy. EcoMate equips individuals and communities with the tools they need to actively contribute to the development of a greener and more sustainable future by utilizing cutting-edge technology.</p>

<h2> Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) </h2>
This project seeks to contribute to the attainment of the following SDGs:

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Globally sustainable consumption and production patterns are the goal of SDG 12. It emphasizes on resource efficiency, reducing waste production, and putting into practice waste management techniques that are friendly to the environment. This objective places a focus on the necessity of reducing waste generation and increasing recycling, reuse, and safe disposal techniques which will be promoted through the features that EcoMate has.</p>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This SDG emphasizes combating climate change, strengthening resilience, and mitigating emissions through urgent action. Although EcoMate may not directly fulfill all of the goals in this SDG, it can help with efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. This application will encourage users to adopt habits that lessen trash production, favor recycling and composting, and discourage the disposal of waste through incineration, which will lead to a reduction in emissions and aid in efforts to mitigateÂ climate change.</p>

# Development Model

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application's developers have utilized agile development model in creating the application. As shown in the figure below, the model is consist of six phases namely Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Launching and Review. The framework allows the developers to modify each processes to fulfill the objectives.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first phase of the development model wherein the developers have identified the objectives of creating the application. In addition to this, different requirements have been identified such as the programming languages to be utilized in order to meet the desired output.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This phase involves outlining the application's features, structures, criteria and deliverables in compliance with the specified requirements. This is where the graphical user interface is created. In creating such, the developers is considered the user's perspectives.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the phase wherein the outlines created in the second phase is turned to a real one through codes manipulation. It is where the desired application will be created.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make sure that the application will be working with minimal to no bugs and errors, the developers will have the application tested first which will takes place in this phase. It will determine whether the application's functions and features is working as it should be.</p>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This phase invloves deploying the application for mass usage in a real-world environment.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where the erorrs and bugs faced during the launching should be addressed and continuous improvement of the application should be made.</p>
